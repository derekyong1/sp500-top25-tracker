# SP500-Top25-Tracker
Tracking Top S&amp;P 500 Companies Ranking by Market Cap

Context:
Market Capitalization is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. The S&P 500 is a market-capitalization-weighted index, which means companies with larger market caps have a bigger impact on the index's performance. A significant price movement in a large-cap stock can move the index more than a similar movement in a smaller-cap stock.


Purpose:
To see the number of companies that are in the green or in the red for the day. Thus, giving an insight of whether the S&P 500 is in the red or green for the day.
